# note-taker 

## Description

A tool for small business owners to write and save notes in order to keep track of tasks. Upon initialization, the user is greeted with a landing page containing a start button that redirects to the notes page. A column of previously written notes is present, and a title and text field for writing a new note sit in the center of the screen. Only when both the title and text fields are filled will a save button appear in the top right corner. Clicking on previously written notes will display their contents in the main fields, and these notes can be deleted using the red delete button on each entry. At any time, a blank note can be initialized by clicking the "+" button in the top right corner.
